- Need to include 

		# include <stdio.h> 

	 this allows us to input and output things. 
- white space is extra space where it's unnecessary, for example indents, space between parts of functions or whole lines of gaps

		printf("hello world"); 
		& 
		printf ( "hello world " ) ; 
		
	these both work the exact same thing. 

- Every line in a function needs to end in a semi colon ; 
	This symbolises the end of a line
- The names of functions and commands are case sensitive 

		int main() { 
	this is a function that is built into c so this is ALWAYS lower case

- When printing a string, you want to use  " " , not ' ', the apostrophes only work for single characters, if you declare them first. 
 - exit code 0 means everything was successful, returns with greater numbers are used to specify an error, similar to the google error 404
Compilers do this themselves but sometimes you want to assert your own 
- The type of a function is predefined with the prefix: 

		int main() {             this is an integer
